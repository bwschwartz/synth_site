in browser modular synth 


The goal is to present a few synthesizer modules that connect together through physically realistic patch cables. There should be at least: an  oscillator bank, a mixer and two speakers. Additional features will be a filter bank based on the filters implemented in the Pydub library, a step sequencewr and physically realistic panning based on drag and drop-able speaker icons.


Functionaliy and MVPS

1) Ability to emulate a basic modular synth setup in the browser with VCO and VCA
2) Physically realistic patch chords

In Addition, this project will include
1) Drag and drop-able skeumorphic icons
2) A filter bank
3) A step sequencer outputting frequency values
